Perfectionism is a personality trait characterized by a strong desire to achieve flawlessness and high standards. It involves setting impossibly high expectations for oneself and others and being overly critical of mistakes or perceived failures. Perfectionists often fear failure, rejection, and criticism, and may struggle with feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Perfectionism can manifest in various areas of life, such as work, school, relationships, and personal goals. It can lead to a lack of satisfaction or fulfillment, as the focus is on achieving an unattainable ideal rather than recognizing progress or growth.
